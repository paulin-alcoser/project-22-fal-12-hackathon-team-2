        "about":"I am a Web Developer and a CS undergrad student, presently on my senior year at New York University Abu Dhabi. Although I am majoring in Computer Science, I gathered my first experiences building websites by taking classes in the Interactive Media Arts program of my university. This multidisciplinay background gave me a passion for the coding and storytelling components of web development. I enjoy building servers and interactive front-ends, as much as I enjoy designing websites as mediums for storytelling. I just finished a software engineer internship at the start up Dapi, where I used puppeteer to reverse engineer the front-end of different websites to create bots.",
